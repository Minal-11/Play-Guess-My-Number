# PLAY GUESS MY NUMBER 
####  It is one of the games which we have been playing till now using pen and paper. However, this game is a slightly modified version of the existing pen and paper game, with the following features:
1. It can be played digitally.
2. It has amazing audio effects when buttons are clicked, enhancing user engagement.
3. It also provides hints to help players progress to the winner stage.
4. It offers two levels, allowing users to play different difficulty levels (hard and easy).
5. It includes astonishing emojis when you win the game.
6. It can be played individually or in groups.

## Why this Project!
* The idea is to create a real-life game application with features like an onClick button and interactive audio, which the user can hear. 
* This project helps me understand how efficiently we can create a game by applying fundamental knowledge of computer science.
* This project helps me to implement and play around with the frontend tech stacks: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* This revives the old memories of mostly playing pen and paper games.

# Resources 
* Online tutorials for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
